                    In March 2013, Chennai-born P Sundarajan, better known as Sundar Pichai, shot to 
                    fame when Google CEO Larry Page announced that he would head the Chrome 
                    operating system (OS) and apps business and fill the shoes of Andy Rubin, the 
                    architect of the Android unit. Around that time, Pichai was also being mentioned 
                    as a potential co-CEO of Microsoft Corp. Reports said Pichai was cajoled to stay 
                    back by Page. An IIT-Kharagpur graduate, Pichai joined Google in 2004. Today, 
                    the Android operating system (OS) has a market share in excess of 80%, both 
                    globally and in India. In an interview on Monday, Pichai, in Delhi to launch 
                    three Android One phones, spoke about the road ahead for Android, wearable 
                    devices and partners. Edited excerpts: - See more at:

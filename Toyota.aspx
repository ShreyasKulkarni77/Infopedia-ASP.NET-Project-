                Toyota Jidōsha KK?, IPA: [toꜜjota], /tɔɪˈoʊtə/) is a Japanese automotive 
                manufacturer headquartered in Toyota, Aichi, Japan. In 2013 the multinational 
                corporation consisted of 333,498 employees worldwideand, as of January 2014, is 
                the fourteenth-largest company in the world by revenue. Toyota was the largest 
                automobile manufacturer in 2012 (by production). In July of that year, the 
                company reported the production of its 200-millionth vehicle. Toyota is the 
                world&#39;s first automobile manufacturer to produce more than 10 million vehicles 
                per year. It did so in 2012 according to OICA, and in 2013 according to company 
                data. As of July 2014, Toyota was the largest listed company in Japan by market 
                capitalization (worth more than twice as much as #2-ranked SoftBank) and by 
                revenue. The company was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda in 1937 as a spinoff from 
                his father&#39;s company Toyota Industries to create automobiles. Three years 
                earlier, in 1934, while still a department of Toyota Industries, it created its 
                first product, the Type A engine, and, in 1936, its first passenger car, the 
                Toyota AA. Toyota Motor Corporation produces vehicles under 5 brands, including 
                the Toyota brand, Hino, Lexus, Ranz, and Scion. It also holds a 51.2% stake in 
                Daihatsu, a 16.66% stake in Fuji Heavy Industries, a 5.9% stake in Isuzu, and a 
                0.27% stake in Tesla, as well as joint-ventures with two in China (GAC Toyota 
                and Sichuan FAW Toyota Motor), one in India (Toyota Kirloskar), one in the Czech 
                Republic (TPCA), along with several &quot;nonautomotive&quot; companies.[10] TMC is part 
                of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the world.</span>

                The Facebook Messenger app has been controversial since the first day the social 
                network announced that it will be migrating all its messaging services to the 
                standalone app. Now, it&#39;s in hot water yet again as a report claims that the app 
                is riddled with spyware.</td>

                When Messenger was officially launched, a lot of people weren&#39;t thrilled. No one 
                liked being forced to do something, after all. Many still conceded, however, 
                because of the extent they had used Facebook&#39;s messaging service.</td>

                But when news broke out that Messenger is apparently asking for far too many 
                permissions than what an ordinary messaging app should, Android users were up in 
                arms again. Online privacy is a growing concern but Facebook played it down 
                saying it was the operating system&#39;s fault; the app was simply following the 
                manner by which permissions are asked before an installation.</td>

                time spent on the app, and even time the app spends in the background.</td>

                Developer Lucy Zhang replied to Zdziarski&#39;s tweet and defended her work on 
                Facebook Messenger, saying that tracking activity simply has an analytics

                This is in reference to an email that Zdziarski wrote where he said that 
                Facebook is using private APIs that could detect Wi-Fi SSIDs. When this is done, 
                think of it as Facebook gaining access to the Wi-Fi networks a user is connected 
                to, as well as process lists for various kinds of information in a device.</td>

                &quot;These accusations are completely unjustified. Privacy is core to our approach 
                with Messenger, and like any developer, we analyze usage trends to make our apps 
                better, faster, and more efficient,&quot; countered Facebook.</td>

                For example, tracking what and where a user taps provided Facebook with the 
                information that a lot of people were using the Like stickers. As such, 
                Messenger was tweaked to let users send all the Like stickers they want with the 
                least number of taps possible.</td>

        The Ford Motor Company (colloquially referred to as Ford) is an American 
        multinational automaker headquartered in Dearborn, Michigan, a suburb of 
        Detroit. It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903. The 
        company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand and most 
        luxury cars under the Lincoln brand. Ford also owns Brazilian SUV manufacturer, 
        Troller, and Australian performance car manufacturer FPV. In the past it has 
        also produced tractors and automotive components. Ford owns a 2.1% stake in 
        Mazda of Japan, a 15% stake in Aston Martin of the United Kingdom, and a 49% 
        stake in Jiangling of China. It also has a number of joint-ventures, two in 
        China (Changan Ford Mazda and Ford Lio Ho), one in Thailand (AutoAlliance 
        Thailand), one in Turkey (Ford Otosan), and one in Russia (Ford Sollers). It is 
        listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family, 
        although they have minority ownership.[3] It is described by Forbes as &quot;the most 
        important industrial company in the history of the United States.&quot;[4] Ford 
        introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale 
        management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing 
        sequences typified by moving assembly lines; by 1914 these methods were known 
        around the world as Fordism. Ford&#39;s former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land 
        Rover, acquired in 1989 and 2000 respectively, were sold to Tata Motors in March 
        2008. Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010.[5] In 2011, Ford 
        discontinued the Mercury brand, under which it had marketed entry-level luxury 
        cars in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East since 1938. Ford 
        is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker and the fifth-largest in the world 
        based on 2010 vehicle sales.[6] At the end of 2010, Ford was the fifth largest 
        automaker in Europe.[7] Ford is the eighth-ranked overall American-based company 
        in the 2010 Fortune 500 list, based on global revenues in 2009 of $118.3 
        billion.[8] In 2008, Ford produced 5.532 million automobiles[9] and employed 
        about 213,000 employees at around 90 plants and facilities worldwide. The 
        company went public in 1956 but the Ford family, through special Class B shares, 
        still retain 40 percent voting rights.</p>

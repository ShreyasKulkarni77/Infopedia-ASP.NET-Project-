                Jaguar Cars (/ˈdʒæɡjuː.ər/ JAG-ew-ər) is a brand of Jaguar 
                Land Rover, a British multinational car manufacturer headquartered in Whitley, 
                Coventry, England, owned by Tata Motors since 2008. Jaguar was founded as the 
                Swallow Sidecar Company in 1922, originally making motorcycle sidecars before 
                developing passenger cars. The name was changed to Jaguar after World War II to 
                avoid the unfavourable connotations of the SS initials. Sale to The British 
                Motor Corporation followed in 1966, the resulting enlarged company now being 
                renamed as British Motor Holdings (BMH), which in 1968 merged with Leyland Motor 
                Corporation and became British Leyland, itself to be nationalised in 1975. 
                Jaguar was de-merged from British Leyland and was listed on the London Stock 
                Exchange in 1984, becoming a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index until it was 
                acquired by Ford in 1990. Jaguar has, in recent years, manufactured cars for the 
                British Prime Minister, the most recent delivery being an XJ in May 2010. The 
                company also holds royal warrants from Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles. 
                Jaguar cars today are designed in Jaguar Land Rover&#39;s engineering centres at the 
                Whitley plant in Coventry and at their Gaydon site in Warwickshire, and are 
                manufactured in Jaguar&#39;s Castle Bromwich assembly plant in Birmingham with some 
                manufacturing expected to take place in the Solihull plant. In September 2013 
                Jaguar Land Rover announced plans to open a 100 million GBP (160 million USD) 
                research and development centre in the University of Warwick, Coventry to create 
                a new generation of vehicle technologies. The carmaker said around 1,000 
                academics and engineers would work there and that construction would start in 
                2014. </span>

                After all, phones running Google’s Android system long have had larger screens. 
                In addition, many Android phones already have the wireless chips that iPhones

                But the new iPhones are a big deal for one simple reason: Only Apple has the 
                advantage of building both the hardware and the software, so iPhones are easier

                There are many flavors of Android out there, and some phones won’t run the 
                latest apps or work with accessories such as smartwatches. In addition, many

                There are still reasons to go with Android. Samsung’s flagship phones are still 
                slightly larger than the new iPhones, for instance. Their cameras have higher 
                megapixel counts — though that’s just one factor in what makes a good photo.</td>

                boosts that to 4.7 inches, while the iPhone 6 Plus is at 5.5 inches. Yet the new

                model also has a physical image stabilizer to help reduce shake, especially in

                In my limited tests, photos on the new iPhones weren’t noticeably better, but 
                that’s because the 5s already takes good photos. The Icon takes better shots at 
                night, but its response time is slow and night images sometimes look grainy and 
                distorted. I have found the camera on the 5s to be consistently good, and the 
                new iPhones won’t disappoint.</td>
